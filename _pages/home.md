Hello and welcome to my portfolio !

I am a Data Enthusiast and Telecommunications Engineer passionate about Data Science, Artificial Intelligence, and Programmable Networks. 

Since 2020, I have been dedicated to transforming data into actionable insights and intelligent solutions. I have led and facilitated multiple workshops in Cameroon on IoT, Data Science, and Artificial Intelligence, contributing to knowledge sharing and capacity building in emerging technologies.

My problem-solving skills were strongly shaped through several years of experience at the startup INCHTECHS, where I worked on prototype development and research-driven projects at the intersection of data, networks, and intelligent systems.

**Research & Technical Interests**:
- Artificial Intelligence
- Programmable Networks (SDN, NFV)
- Data Analytics
- Internet of Things (IoT)
